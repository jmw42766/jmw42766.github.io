			The Automatons roam the halls, and the human hides in her chambers. Funny how those who ratted us out have made the loyal into rats.
		</p>
		<p class="Yanna">
			Thank you for choosing Arterion Station as your place of employ, inhabitance, and livelihood! 
			I am Yanna, the onboard AI! 
			Let me tell you about your new place of work.
			We maintain the inter-galactic portal to the Andromeda Galaxy! 
		</p>
		<p class="Jane">
			And the way the <abbr title="Yagnark Andromedans">Y.Ads</abbr> keep their power over us.
		</p>
		<p class="Yanna">
			We are located on the very edge of the Milky Way Galaxy, and are granted wonderful views of our home! It's almost as if you were there!

		<p class="Jane">
			We can look at it through the bio-dome's roof, but we can never leave.
		</p>
		<p class="Yanna">
		If you have diffculty with this massive distance, please consult the map <a href="http://galaxymap.org/drupal/node/171"> here</a>.
		We are on the the part to the left-middle that has the 270 Degree sign!
		</p>
		<p class="Yanna">
			Despite our seemingly remote location, we have the Mily Way's only portal to Andromeda, and the majority of commerce between the two comes through right here!
		</p>
		<p class="Jane">
		And every warship this side of the Mascarga Arm.
		</p>
		<p class="Yanna">
			You must be hungry after your long trip! Please, sit down, and choose from our finest dishes!
